            <blockquote>Be grateful for what you have now. As you begin to think about all the things in your life you
                are grateful for, you will be amazed at the never ending thoughts that come back to you of more things
                to be grateful for. You have to make a start, and then the law of attraction will receive those grateful
                thoughts and give you more just like them.
